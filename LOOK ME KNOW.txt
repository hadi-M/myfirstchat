Hey :)
first of all i've did this project with nodejs sockets for having a better experience. because of the html and css you know.
so first of all install the node js.
then cd to this directory and do a "npm install"
then do a "node app.js <port>" and port is the... you know :D
like: node app.js 12345
then using your browser (please not IE, and please use Chrome) visit the page, for instance "http://127.0.0.1:12345".
and enjoy :D
and the IDs formats are line "ID*" for example to connect, use this command on the little black terminal in the page "Connect ID1"
and one last thing, the reason of my delay was that i was doing my project using python, and so the UI would have been the cli, and if that was the case, it would suck you know?
so right in the middle of the project i changed my way to node js and so as you can see, i did the UI using html, css3, and js. which got to be pretty cool :D
